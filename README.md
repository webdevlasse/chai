# What is Wi-Chai?

### Ever encountered the problem of wanting to work from a coffee-shop on a rainy sunday?

Remember the experience you had, when you just stumbled in the first one you saw, all soaking wet?
Loud music, bad coffee, your laptops battery is starving but there is no free plug and worst of all the wifi tubes are clogged!

If you nodded in agreement, don't you worry no more,
cause Wi-Chai's got your back!

We'll find you the best coffee-shop based on the three aforementioned categories:
Atmosphere | Wifi | Power 


# How does it work?

'How do I find the best coffee shop?' I hear you scream in deafening silence, well let me tell you.

Based on your current location or on a user defined location we'll find coffee-shops around you.

These will be sorted by their wifi quality, their amount of power socket and finally their overall working environment (is it noisy? is there enough room, etc).

The overall score is represented in what we call Chai-Score - an aggregated score based on the individual categories.


# This coffee-shop was great / horrible how can I let others know about this?

Easy peasy! Rate the shop!

You can rate every category in a range between 1-5.
Once you're done, your score will be added to the shops overall score for the whole world to see.

FEATURES NEEDED:(please add to the list)
- the ability to drag and drop marker for new center of search. 
- the ability to drag the map and see more results.
- Add Seating to the rating of a shop.
- If the data in the DB is old, get more recent data from external sources (data could have changed, more shops added, etc.)

BUGS to Fix:
- Remove the History push state to accomodate other/older browers (use something else)
- After rating a shop in a remote search, the map centers around the location of the user. It should stay centered on the searched area
- When the address field is empty and you click the search button an error pops up
